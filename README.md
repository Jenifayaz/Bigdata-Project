# Bigdata-Project
→	Formulating and solving a linear program to determine the portfolio of stocks, bonds, and options that maximises expected profit.

→	Investment Grade Prediction using Neural Network & machine Learning Models.

→Investigated a Financial data to predict a whether it is an investment grade or not.

• Balanced the data using Random Sampler Technique for optimized prediction.

• For tuning, LASSO and RIDGE Regularization methods were applied in Logistic Regression.

• Also predicted Rating by using Neural Network Model.
